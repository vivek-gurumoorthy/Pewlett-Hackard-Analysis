# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into which employees at Pewlett Hackard are likely to retire in the coming years. Additionally, quantifying and categorizing these results assists in helping the company understand the areas from which it is going to lose employees in the future. This information can be used to inform hiring strategies as well as other internal initiatives such as mentoring programs for more junior employees.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: 
* Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
